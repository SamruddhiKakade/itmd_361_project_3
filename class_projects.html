    <p><strong>CS 429 (Information retrieval)</strong></p>
    <p>The primary aim of this project was to construct a fundamental search engine using Scrapy, Flask, and Python.</p>
    <p>In the age of information, search engines have become vital tools for retrieving and managing vast amounts of data from the internet. In this endeavor, we developed a basic search engine that operated based on keyword matches. Using Scrapy, a Python-based tool, we crawled several predefined websites and indexed the collected data. The search results would then rank pages based on the number and relevance of keyword appearances.To provide an interface for user interaction, we utilized Flask a micro web framework in Python. The web interface enabled users to input their search queries and receive the respective results.</p>
    <p>By the project's conclusion, we successfully achieved a search engine that, while basic, effectively indexed and retrieved relevant web content based on user queries</p>

    <p><strong>MBA 532 (Artificial Intelligence)</strong></p>
    <p>Exploring artificial intelligence's potential and showcasing practical applications using IBM resources.</p>
    <p>This project spanned over the course duration, divided into two main components. In the initial phase, our team dived into IBM's resources, especially the Watson platform, solving a series of labs that tested our comprehension and application of AI concepts.The latter phase encompassed a detailed study of the broader applications of AI in modern industries. After rigorous research, our team decided to pitch an AI solution for optimizing supply chain logistics for e-commerce platforms.</p>
    <p>The final presentation, showcasing the AI-based solution for e-commerce logistics, received acclaim from peers and instructors alike. Additionally, the experience granted a prestigious IBM Artificial Intelligence Practitioner Certificate.</p>

    <p><strong>IPRO 1</strong></p>
    <p>Creating a user-friendly online platform where individuals could sell or purchase used books.</p>
    <p>By project completion, the platform not only allowed users to list books for sale but also ensured a secure environment for communication and transaction.</p>
    <p>To address the challenge of sourcing affordable textbooks, our team embarked on developing an online marketplace specifically tailored for used books. Django was the chosen backend framework, thanks to its robustness and scalability, while the frontend was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A unique feature was the integrated messaging system, ensuring buyers and sellers could communicate seamlessly.</p>
